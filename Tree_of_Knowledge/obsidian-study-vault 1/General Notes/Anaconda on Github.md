- Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for "Python: Select Interpreter."
- Choose the desired Anaconda environment (e.g., `base` or a custom environment) from the list. This tells VS Code which Python interpreter to use for your project.
- - **Activate Environments and Install Packages in the Integrated Terminal:**
    - Open a new integrated terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+`).
    - The chosen Anaconda environment should automatically activate (indicated by the environment name in parentheses in the prompt).
    - You can now use `conda` commands (e.g., `conda install <package_name>`) to manage packages within that environment.
